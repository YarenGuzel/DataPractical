## Introduction

In this study, I will compare the fertility ages of women living in Turkey according to the years **2008-2021**. My main purpose here is to examine the effect of increasing the rate of education and the fact that women are more in education and business life on the age of giving birth. The question I focus on in this study; What effect does education level have on women's age at birth? I argue that the increase in the level of education and the participation of more women in business life delay the birth age of women living in Turkey.

In this study, I will especially focus on mothers under the age of 20. Generally, pregnancies under the age of 20 are considered adolescent pregnancies [@selma2011ccocuk]. But in order to make comparisons, I included *20-24* years old and *25-29* years old in my study.

My previous research was examined as two different subjects. [@baytun2013turkiye]and [@ozaydinlik2014toplumsal] focused on female literacy in Turkey. [@selma2011ccocuk; @yilmaz201515; @burcu2015ccicceklerin] j worked on child marriage and births. My research covers all these studies.

## Method

This study compares the previous data of the Turkish Statistical Institute. For this, two separate data sets were used.

-   Data set:

1)  Gender and educational background
2)  Women's ages and births

These two data were analyzed comparatively.

```{r}
library(readxl)
Education_by_gender <- read_excel("C:/Users/win11/Desktop/Data science/Education by gender.xls")
View(Education_by_gender)
```

```{r}
library(readxl)
Births_by_mother_s_age <- read_excel("C:/Users/win11/Desktop/Data science/Births by mother's age.xlsx")
View(Births_by_mother_s_age)

```

## Resuts

```{r}
plot(Education_by_gender, type= "l", main = "Education Rate")
```

In the chart above, the reading rates of women are given. From 2008 to 2021, female literacy rates have been steadily increasing. In fact, in 2021, this rate has approached almost 100%. In the continuation of the study, I will examine the age groups one by one. The reason for this is to be able to clearly show the changes in the groups. For this study, I divided my age groups into five different groups.

1.  under 15 ages
2.  15-17 ages
3.  18-19
4.  20-24
5.  25-29

```{r}
barplot(table(sample(2008:2021, size = 5000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1261,956,716,583,568,449,436,321,309,280,198,157,119,117))), xlab = "Years", ylab = "Births", main = "Births under 15 ages")
```

The first group I will examine is those who are mothers under the age of 15. Individuals in this group are called adolescent pregnancy. As you can see in the graph, it has decreased considerably from 2008 compared to 2021 snake. Especially since 2018, quite a few women became mothers at a young age.

```{r}
barplot(table(sample(2008:2021, size =  100000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(33719,31596,29449,26420,24098,21967,20682,18841,17092,15189,12037,9981,8185,7073))), xlab = "Years", ylab = "Births", main = "Births 15-17 Ages")
```

The second group I will examine is those who are mothers at the age of 15-17. Individuals in this group are also called adolescent pregnancy. As you can see in the graph, the rates decreased from 2008 to 2021 snakes. However, this decline is not as sharp as the first group, under the age of 15.

```{r}
barplot(table(sample(2008:2021, size = 100000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(85329,79520,72735,70877,70299,67847,65860,61559,59244,54825,48598,43659,37776,32091))), xlab = "Years", ylab = "Births", main = "Births 18-19 Ages")
```

The other group I will examine are those who are 18-19 years old mothers. Individuals in this group are also called adolescent pregnancy. As you can see in the graph, the rates decreased from 2008 to 2021 snakes. However, the decrease in these numbers is unfortunately not significant. Because those are still too high.

```{r}
barplot(table(sample(2008:2021, size = 100000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(375728,358462,344108,334735,332232,232274,327116,315594,390470,302766,285286,263303,245913,229359))), xlab = "Years", ylab = "Births", main = "Births Between 20-24 Ages")
```

I used the next two age groups for comparison purposes only. Individuals in these groups are not counted as adolescent births. When we look at the chart, we see fluctuations. Specifically, we cannot say that births have increased or decreased from 2008 to 2021.

```{r}
barplot(table(sample(2008:2021, size = 1000000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(414075,401079,396887,389397,397945,400292,416737,414956,406808,403657,392701,377338,358542,353824))), xlab = "Years", ylab = "Births", main = "Births Between 25-29 Ages")
```

There are also fluctuations in this chart. However, we can say that the general birth rate decreased after 2014. It is not possible to associate this decrease with education, as I have claimed. The main reason for this is that, according to the Turkish Statistics Committee, 50.8% of women have joined the workforce since these years.

### Statictical Result

```{r}
str(Births_by_mother_s_age)

```

```{r}
summary(Births_by_mother_s_age)
```

```{r}
data1 <- as.numeric(unlist(Births_by_mother_s_age))
```

```{r}
summary(Births_by_mother_s_age$`<15`)
sd(Births_by_mother_s_age$`<15`)
```

As you can see, the average of women who are mothers under the age of 15 is 462.1 and standard deviation is 333.9143.

```{r}
summary(Births_by_mother_s_age$`15-17`)
sd(Births_by_mother_s_age$`15-17`)
```

As you can see, the average of women who are mothers age between 15 and 17 is 19738 and standard deviation is 8667.992.

```{r}
summary(Births_by_mother_s_age$`18-19`)
sd(Births_by_mother_s_age$`18-19`)
```

As you can see, the average of women who are mothers age between 18 and 19 is 63710 and standard deviation is 15682.52.

## General Discussion

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=Education_by_gender, aes(x = `Rate%`, y = `Year`), x= "Year", y= "Rate%") +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(Births_by_mother_s_age, aes(x = `Year`, y = `<15`), xlab = "Births", ylab = "Years") +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(Births_by_mother_s_age, aes(x = `Year`, y = `15-17`), xlab = "Births", ylab = "Years") +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(Births_by_mother_s_age, aes(x = `Year`, y = `18-19`), xlab = "Births", ylab = "Years") +
  geom_point()
```

As I claim, given the above rates, the level of education has increased significantly over the years. This shows that women are more involved in education. On the other hand, there is a decrease in birth rates especially in adolescent gestational ages (under 15 -- under 20 years old). In the distribution tables I have given above, we see more clearly that the number of births has decreased. One of the main reasons for this can be shown as the increase in education level. Apart from this, birth rates have decreased due to women's participation in the labor force, especially at the age of 25-29.

When analyzed statistically, especially the number of adolescent pregnancies is high. However, when the minimum and maximum values are compared, a decrease in these numbers is observed. As a result, as I claimed, the increasing education rate since 2008 has reduced the rate of having a baby at a young age.

Many institutions like these two institutions are working for the education of children today. Its main objectives are to complete the education of all children living in Turkey and to ensure equality between men and women in the field of education.
